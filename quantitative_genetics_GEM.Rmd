## Inclusion and Accessibility

Please tell me your preferred pronouns and/or name, especially if it differs from the class roster. I take seriously my responsibility to create inclusive learning environments. Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your participation! You are also encouraged to contact the Accessible Education Center in 164 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or uoaec@uoregon.edu.

I am committed to making this course an inclusive and respectful learning space. Being respectful includes using preferred pronouns for your classmates. Your classmates come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences; please avoid assumptions or stereotypes, and aim for inclusivity. Let us know if there are classroom dynamics that impede your (or someone elseâ€™s) full engagement.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this course is being delivered entirely remotely. I realize that this situation makes it difficult for some students to interact with the material, for a variety of reasons. I am committed to flexibility during this stressful time and emphasize that I will work with students to overcome difficult barriers as they arise.

# Phenotypic traits and values

## Introduction

Many phenotypes of organisms are complex, meaning that they are the product of multiple loci interacting with one another and the environment to create smooth distributions.
